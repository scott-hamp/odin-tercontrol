# odin-tercontrol

A cross-platform (Linux/Windows) terminal package for Odin, based on [tercontrol](https://github.com/ZackeryRSmith/tercontrol) by ZackeryRSmith. It does not depend on any pre-existing terminal libraries like ncurses or pdcurses.

The source includes an example in main.odin and the package itself. Run build.sh to build the entire project, or just build-lib.sh to build the library for your platform. Building the library will require gcc.
